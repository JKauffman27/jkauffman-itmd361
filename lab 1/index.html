  <p>Hello, my name is Jordan Kauffman.</p>
  <p>I am a second year ITM Student currently on a ITM Cybersecurity course track. I enjoy reading comics and manga, as well as playing video games.</p>
  <p>My favorite TV show is the Cowboy Bebop anime, my current favorite manga is Chainsaw Man, and my favorite video game is probably Bioshock or Super Mario Galaxy.<p>
  <p>However, I do have over 1,000 hours in Darkest Dungeon, so one could assume that is also my favorite.<p>
  <p>Look forward to working with and getting to know all of you!<p>
